# Technology Transfer

We provide technology transfer services with the goal of developing sustainable
scientific solutions to environmental and public health challenges. We specialize in
technology transfer in the areas of solid waste management, water sanitation, and
health goods and services. We are particularly focused on potable and wastewater
treatment units for various communities with limited access to water and
sanitation. Training and capacity building of relevant workers and stakeholders is a
critical component of our approach to technology transfer.

[Recently](/news), EEHS partnered up with [Binee](http://www.binee.com),
a German startup designing state-of-the art recycling bins connected to
smartphones, to pursue projects that incentivize individual and community sorting
and recycling of waste.
