# Other Services

We also provide a wide range of additional consulting services to tackle
environmental and public health challenges.

## Contaminated Soil Remediation

Oil contamination of soil and groundwater poses major hazards to health and the
environment.  Hydrocarbon introduction into soil can occur from pipeline blow-
outs, road accidents, and leaking of underground storage tanks. We specialize in
clean up of oil-contaminated soil and other areas of environmental remediation.

## Activity Hazard Analysis

Activity Hazard Analyses (AHAs) define the activities being performed and identify
the work sequences, the specific anticipated hazards, site conditions, equipment,
materials and the control measures to be implemented to eliminate or reduce each
hazard to an acceptable level of risk. We provide clients with the technical support
necessary to develop and implement AHAs.

## Accident Prevention Plans

Accident Prevention Plans (APPs) are performed in order to fully comply with
relevant safety and health policies and regulations. The elements of APPs cover a
broad spectrum of areas and are designed to prevent accidents and injuries. Taken
individually, the plan elements have minimal effect. As a whole, and with the
support of employees at all levels, APPs can reduce the number and severity of job
related injuries to employees. We provide expert advice to support clients in their
development of APPs and related efforts to ensure safety in the workplace.

## Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plans

We work closely with clients to develop and carry out Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plans (SWPPPs). SWPPs are required for any construction and industrial
facilities that discharge storm water. A SWPPP identifies potential pollutant sources
and describes practices that will be implemented to prevent or control pollutant
releases to storm water discharges.
