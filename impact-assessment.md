# Impact Assessment

We specialize in impact assessment for various environmental and health-related
efforts, from large-scale construction projects to local development programs such
as recycling campaigns and community health services. We have ongoing and
completed projects in Lebanon, Kenya, and Iraq.

## Environmental and Health Impact Assessments

Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and Health Impact Assessments (HIAs)
analyze the potential environmental, health, social, and economic consequences of a
proposed project. An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) concisely summarizes a
projectâ€™s environmental effects and proposes action points to reduce and eliminate
potential harm to public health and the environment. We assist clients in identifying
and implementing EIAs and HIAs and help them navigate the EIS process.

## Environmental Management Plans

Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) are site-specific frameworks developed
to ensure that all necessary measures are identified and implemented in order to
protect the environment and comply with environmental laws. We provide technical
assistance with the development and implementation of EMPs.

## Monitoring and Evaluation

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) serves as a critical approach for assessing the
effectiveness of environmental, health, and development programs and policies.
M&E also provides accountability for project goals and objectives. We work with
clients to conduct M&E ranging from small-scale projects to national frameworks
and strategies.
