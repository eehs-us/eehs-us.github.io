# Green Building

## Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)

LEED is a program that provides third-party verification of green buildings. Building
projects satisfy prerequisites and earn points to achieve different levels of
certification. Prerequisites and credits differ for each rating system, and teams
choose the best fit for the project. LEED is currently being used in more than 130
countries. We guide our clients through the process of obtaining LEED Certification
from the United States Green Building Council.

## Green Roofs and Walls

We offer consulting and implementation services for planting green roofs and green
walls. Green roofs and walls are cooler, save energy, provide a filter for storm water
run-off, and serve as communal spaces. They also help lower urban air temperatures
and mitigate the heat island. A green roof or wall can contain over a thousand
plants, all of which filter air and in addition create energy-rich oxygen. Green roofs
are also referred to as eco-roofs, oikosteges, vegetated roofs, living roofs, and VCWH
(Horizontal Vegetated Complex Walls).
