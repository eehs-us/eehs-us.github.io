# Waste Management

We specialize in solid waste management (SWM) services including:

- Geotechnical and geo-environmental design and engineering of sanitary landfills
- Design and assessment of sorting and composting facilities
- Environmental and Health Impact Assessment of SWM projects
- Training and capacity building for governments, communities, and other stakeholders on SWM
- Education and public awareness campaigns on sorting, recycling, composting, and other SWM issues.

EEHS also has labs for soil, water, and air quality testing. We completed a major
project for the Tripoli landfill in Lebanon conducting geotechnical and
geo-environmental design including slope stability investigation and leachate
draining systems. We are currently [Link to News and Updates] working on two
sorting and composting facilities in Lebanon including the engineering design
and environmental and health impact assessments.
